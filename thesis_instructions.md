# Checklist of Master's Thesis (Draft)

## How to Use
Examine all the questions and tick if you fulfill them. If you have a checkbox unticked, you should have justified reasons and discuss them with your supervisor.

---

## Important Sections

### Thesis
- [ ] The research questions to solve are clearly stated in the thesis. (State where.)
- [ ] I have clarified my/the thesis' contributions. (State where.)
- [ ] I have discussed delimitations and/or limitations.
- [ ] I have discussed ethical considerations (if applicable).
- [ ] My thesis is not primarily concerned with implementations (e.g., program design and coding).
- [ ] I solve an important (generic) research question, not limited to contributing to the hosting company (if your thesis is hosted by a company).
- [ ] My thesis is significantly different from a technical report, focusing on research, not just describing how a task was completed.
- [ ] I have regularly discussed progress with my supervisor, especially regarding the expectation matrix.

---

### Writing
- [ ] My texts are original. I did not copy-paste from other sources.
- [ ] My research questions and solutions are mathematically formulated.
- [ ] My texts are true, precise, and scholarly (e.g., avoid statements like "xxx is all you need").
- [ ] If I used AI language tools (e.g., ChatGPT), I clarified their usage in the thesis.
- [ ] I am consistent in using either British or US English.
- [ ] I have checked the grammar and typos thoroughly.

---

### Visualization and Tables
- [ ] Figures are easy to read, and their captions explain:
  1. How to read the figures.
  2. The conclusions of the figures.
- [ ] Figures are saved in vector format (e.g., PDF/EPS/PGFPlots/TikZ) whenever applicable.
- [ ] Figures are accessible to visually impaired persons (e.g., colorblind individuals).

---

### Bibliography
- [ ] I have read all the papers I cite in the thesis, and they are relevant and needed.
- [ ] I provided sufficient citations and discussion in the literature review.
- [ ] I checked the quality of all papers, ensuring they are not from untrustworthy/predatory sources.
- [ ] I did not cite non-peer-reviewed sources (e.g., blog posts, Medium).
- [ ] The citation style is consistent (e.g., capitalization in article titles, usage of `\citet` and `\citep`).
- [ ] I did not directly import BibTeX entries from websites without verifying them.

---

### Experiment
- [ ] My experiments are reproducible (i.e., details provided to reproduce the results accurately).
- [ ] Results are reported with statistics (e.g., quantiles or standard deviation).
- [ ] I have analyzed and discussed the results, and they are definitive.
- [ ] The experiment results support the main claim of the thesis.

---

### Math and LaTeX
- [ ] I used professional tools to typeset my thesis (e.g., LaTeX). Word is not considered appropriate.
- [ ] For all theoretical results, I stated the full set of assumptions, and the proofs are complete and correct.
- [ ] I thoroughly checked all formulations in the thesis and confirm their correctness.
- [ ] No obvious LaTeX formatting errors/confusions:
  - Wrong: `$f_{encoder}$`. Correct: `$f_{\mathrm{encoder}}$`.
  - Wrong: `$A^T$` for matrix transpose. Correct: Use proper transpose notation.
  - Wrong: `$\sin^2(x)$` for the square of $\sin(x)`. Correct: `$\sin(x)^2$`.
  - Wrong: `$\int f(x) dx$`. Correct: `$dx$` is the differential operator.

---

### Learning Outcomes and Health
- [ ] I gained substantial new knowledge throughout my thesis work.
- [ ] The knowledge I acquired is helpful for my future developments (e.g., doctoral study, relevant career).
- [ ] I developed independence in conducting research projects.
- [ ] I learned practical skills (e.g., LaTeX, Git, Slurm) that are useful beyond research. (List them.)
- [ ] This thesis is helpful for my planned future career.
- [ ] I feel happy and satisfied with my thesis.
- [ ] I maintained a good work-life balance and avoided overworking.

---

### Others
- [ ] I acknowledged funding agencies and infrastructures used (if applicable).
- [ ] The authors' contributions are detailed if the thesis has multiple authors.

---

## Optional (The More You Tick, the Better Your Thesis)
- [ ] I release public codes of my experiments.
- [ ] My contributions are original and significant, solving problems at the level of a research paper.
- [ ] Figures use the same font as the main text.
- [ ] I used booktabs, microtype, and hyperlinks.
- [ ] My thesis is self-contained, meaning readers do not need extensive external references.
- [ ] I use the Oxford comma consistently (optional but recommended).
- [ ] I distinguish between hyphen, en dash, and em dash.
- [ ] Sections and subsections are not left empty.
- [ ] Figures are easy to read, even when printed out.
